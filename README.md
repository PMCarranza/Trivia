## **Description**
This is multiple selection game, the user reads the question and has four possible answers; if the user chooses correctly a message is displayed confirming the answer, if the answer is wrong, the user will know.  In either case after a few seconds the next question will be displayed until the last question is reached.
The question runs on a timer, if the user runs out of time a message is displayed notifying what happened.

After the last question has been answered a window with the final results will be displayed.
