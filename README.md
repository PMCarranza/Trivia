# **Trivia**
## **Description**
This is multiple selection game, the user reads the question and has four possible answers; if the user chooses correctly a message is displayed confirming the answer, if the answer is wrong, the user will know.  In either case after a seven seconds the next question will be displayed until the last question is reached.
The question runs on a timer, if the user runs out of time a message is displayed notifying what happened.

After the last question has been answered a window with the final results will be displayed and after ten seconds the game restarts.

## **Roadmap**
I do not have concrete plans for the future of this app, it is a very helpful exercise to practice jQuery and timers, I found it challenging but very rewarding.  As time allows I would like to polish the ui.
